## Deployment

### Github, Gitpod, Git and Github pages

- #### To start the project I used Github and Gitpod.

  1. I first signed into Github and located the Code Institute Gitpod template.

     - <div float="left">
          <img src="assets/images/readme/deployment/code-institute-template.png" alt="Image of Code Institute Template" width="840px" height="420px" />
        </div>

  2. I then clicked the use this template button.

     - <div float="left">
           <img src="assets/images/readme/deployment/use-this-template.png" alt="Image of use template button" width="400px" height="200px" />
         </div>

  3. I then named the repository and created it.

     - <div float="left">
           <img src="assets/images/readme/deployment/new-repository.png" alt="Image ofnew repository" width="800px" height="400px" />
         </div>

  4. Once the repository was created I could then open it on Gitpod.

  5. I used my terminal to create my files and folders. .



- #### Git

  1. Throughout the project I used git to save and store my progress.

  2. Once I completed a section I used git add command to add the changes I had made to the staging area.

     - ![Image of add readme file](assets/images/readme/deployment/add-readme.png)

  3. Once the file was staged I the used the git commit command to commit the changes.

     - ![Image of commit readme file](assets/images/readme/deployment/git-readme-commit.png).

  4. Then the changes were pushed to Github using git push command.

  5. The above steps were used for each stage of development throughout the project.
